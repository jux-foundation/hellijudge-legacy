 HelliJudge
 	This is a judging system for onsite & online contests.

 Features
 	TO BE COMPLETED, asap!

 Install & Configuration
	First, install Fedora Linux or something close!
	Edit /etc files according to the ones is etc directory of judge. They
	are the settings responsible for jailing and limitations.
	Edit utils/setenv.sh and set your judge directory in it, then run it.

	Now build a jail. You can find our prepared jail at:
		https://github.com/jux-foundation/hellijudge-jail
	or you can build your own, but remember to add compiler scripts from
	our repo.

/*	Based on your own configuration, do the following:
		mkdir /mnt/jail/home
		mkdir /mnt/jail/source
		ln -s /mnt/jail $JUDGE_PREFIX/jail

		mkdir /var/log/jury
		ln -s /var/log/jury $JUDGE_PREFIX/log
*/
	Start the daemon, then run utils/hellow-tester.sh to test the judge.
	Run utils/bs-tester.sh to test the interactive feature.

	If anything didn't workout, don't worry! I'd be surprised if it did!
